# Patient Admission Scheduling Problem

In 2010, Demeester et al. (2010) defined the patient admission scheduling problem (PASP). In addition, they generated 13 benchmark instances based on hospitals' actual conditions by interviewing patients and made them accessible to other researchers on a website (https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/wim.vancroonenburg/pas/, 2010). 

In 2019, for the first time in the literature, we developed a new version of the patient admission scheduling problem by considering admission time windows assumption for the patients, that will be called PASP_ATW. Therefore, the benchmark instances defined by Demeester et al. (2010) have been updated by adding each patient's earliest and latest admission time. Here we explain how to update the benchmark instances and the results obtained. We updated benchmark instances as follows:

We assumed that in the first week, all patients should be hospitalized on the desired date. In the second week of planning, the earliest and latest admission dates are obtained by decreasing and increasing one day from the desired admission date. The possibility of two days and three days change in the admission time compared to the desired admission date is considered in the third and fourth weeks. Finally, patients' admission dates can be changed up to 4 days from the fifth week to the end of the planning horizon.
