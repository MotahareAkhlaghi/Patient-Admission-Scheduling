# Patient-Admission-Scheduling
For the first time, the patient admission scheduling problem with the time window assumption has been investigated in our paper. Here we explain the method of data generation and the obtained results.
In 2010, Demeester et al. (2010) defined the patient admission scheduling problem. In addition, they generated 13 benchmark instances based on hospitals' actual conditions by interviewing patients and made them accessible to other researchers on a website (https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/wim.vancroonenburg/pas/, 2010).
